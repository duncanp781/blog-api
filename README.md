# Blog Api
The code for the front-end of this website is available [here](https://github.com/duncanp781/blog-frontend).

This project is a full-stack blogging site. 
It allows users to create and edit posts in markdown (using react-md-editor and react-markdown) as well as view and reply to other user's posts.
The front end of the website was made using React, using Material-UI and styled components for the design.
The back end is a REST api made with Node.js and Express, using JSON Web Tokens with bcrypt for authentication.
